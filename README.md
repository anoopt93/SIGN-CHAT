# SIGN-CHAT

MCA Academic Project

SIGN CHAT is an Android chat Application for deaf people to communicate with normal people. 
The application facilitates the communication between normal to deaf people, deaf to deaf people, and normal to normal people.
The American Sign Language (ASL)is used in this application for communication.
Initially, the Sign language is typed by the deaf person on one end of communication side and which is later converted into text on other end of communication side. 
We are developing two applications one for the deaf people and another for normal peoples.
It has following features:-
 Does not require large amount of storage
 The sign words are signed in the same order as letters appear in English alphabets.
 It operates as an interpreter and translator, facilitating and mediating communication between Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Hearing people
 Accurate and appropriate transfer of a message from a source language into a target language based on their style and culture
 Helps learn the culture and history of Deaf people to better understand the communication between Deaf and Hearing individuals.
